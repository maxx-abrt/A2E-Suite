# Phase 13 report — M9 curated templates (L-TPL)

CLAIMED — US-103/bureau-page-templates — deepseek-v4.1-flash — 2026-09-29T20:23:46Z — base 5224ba9c46986750c9b899d3baed2a408b2dcdd7

## 2026-09-29 20:26 UTC — deepseek-v4.1-flash [executor] — contract v4
**Task:** US-103 M9c family: 20 curated Bureau page templates (a2e-documents) · **Slice:** the 20-page family content — add the 15 missing descriptors + extend the missing-titles delta + per-descriptor tests + patch bump
**Claim:** done-for-review
**Ready-to-tick:** yes — all Tier-0 gates green; only the Tier-2 browser leg is absent. One documented scope deviation: the `labels fr+en` descriptor contract is US-117's, not this content slice's (see fr+en note).
**Base:** 5224ba9c46986750c9b899d3baed2a408b2dcdd7
**Changed:**
- `packages/twenty-apps/internal/a2e-documents/src/lib/starter-templates.ts` (+15 descriptors: weekly review, daily note, OKR, team wiki home, onboarding guide, recurring agenda, decision log/ADR, retrospective, brainstorm, reading list, Cornell course notes, thesis planner, recipe book, travel plan, personal CRM-lite)
- `.../src/lib/__tests__/starter-templates.test.ts` (20-title bundle assertion, uniqueness test, one `descriptor « … » is shaped and instantiable` test per descriptor via a loop, delta expectation extended to the 19 missing)
- `.../src/logic-functions/post-install.ts` (template page `first: 30`→`200` + WHY comment — see seeder note)
- `.../package.json` (0.2.1→0.2.2)
- `.../README.md` + `docs/features.md` (five→twenty starter templates, truthful list)
- this report
**Checks:**
- `yarn typecheck` (a2e-documents) → clean (no output)
- `yarn lint` → `Found 0 warnings and 0 errors` (77 files)
- `yarn test:unit` → `tests 221 / pass 221 / fail 0` (was 197; +20 per-descriptor +1 uniqueness +the updated list/delta)
- `npx twenty dev:build .` → `Build succeeded (28 files)`; built `post-install.mjs` carries 20 `title: "Mod\xE8le …"` descriptors
- `node docs/scripts/check-docs.mjs` → `PASS: 26 maintained documents, 214 local inline links`
**Missing for tick:** Tier 2 (orchestrator): install/reinstall `a2e-documents` in a browser and observe all 20 templates appear in the gallery + a template opens with content, and no duplicate on reinstall.
**Do not redo:** the descriptor shape (`{title, markdown}`) and the seeder contract — the app already seeds via `findMissingStarterTemplates` (missing-titles-only) into the `_document` tree; extending the constant is all the "delta" needs. Do not rebuild the template-copy/instantiate path.
**Remaining:** US-104…107 (sibling M9c families), then US-117/US-118/US-119/US-120.
**Next:** US-104 (a2e-projects, 10 missing project templates) per Ralph's queue; the descriptor contract (key/version/labels fr/en/category) is US-117's scope, not this slice's.

### Seeder note (why post-install.ts changed)
`findExistingTemplateTitles` read `first: 30`. At 5 shipped titles that left 25 slots of headroom; at 20 it leaves 10, so a workspace with >10 user-created templates could push a shipped title off the page under a newest-first ordering and the missing-titles delta would re-seed a duplicate. Raised to `first: 200` so the delta stays exhaustive regardless of ordering. Writes are still titles-only into the `_document` tree — the recorded seeder contract is untouched.

### fr+en note (deliberate deviation, not a defect)
This app's content is French-only by construction: all 5 pre-existing descriptors, every sibling family (a2e-projects `starter-projects.ts`, a2e-accounting `fiche-templates.ts`) and the post-install welcome doc are French, and there is no i18n layer in `packages/twenty-apps/internal/*`. The `key/version/labels fr+en/category` descriptor contract named in the AC is US-117's deliverable ("Define the descriptor shape once … each app exposes its templates through its existing lib constants + a logic function returning descriptors"); inventing it here would pre-empt US-117 and add an unconsumed parallel shape. The titles are the user-facing seed strings and are curated French; the fr+en label surface lands with US-117. No catalogs touched.
